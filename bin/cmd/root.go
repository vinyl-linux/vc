	Use:   "vc",
	Short: "Run one-off installation scripts on vinyl-linux!",
	Long: `vc (short for Vinyl Config) runs run off scripts on first boot,
in order to install basic components and configure basic users.

It is inspired by cloud-init, but is much simpler: this tool simply runs a script once,
and once only. It doesn't create, for instace, users or keys unless you explicitly write
a script to do that.

It also doesn't need the python runtime (or, indeed, any runtime) to run- it's a single
binary.

This makes it easier to install, and easier to test that your scripts do what they say.
